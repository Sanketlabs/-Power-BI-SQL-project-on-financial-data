📌 Featured Project:
🔍 Bank Loan Analysis — SQL + Power BI
Dataset | 📜 SQL Queries | 📊 Power BI Dashboard  

Project Objective:
To perform a detailed analysis of bank loan data in order to extract actionable insights on loan performance, payment trends, and customer segmentation—using SQL for data querying and Power BI for interactive visualizations.

🔧 Problem Statement:
Banks handle thousands of loan applications monthly. Understanding key metrics like funded amounts, payment patterns, and risk indicators (like DTI and interest rates) is crucial for decision-making.
The challenge was to:
Track performance metrics (MTD, PMTD, MoM)
Identify trends in interest rates and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios
Classify loans as "Good" or "Bad" based on repayment behavior
Segment customers based on loan purpose, region, employment, and term

✅ Benefits:
📈 Data-Driven Insights: Understand loan performance and repayment behaviors using KPIs
🎯 Better Decision-Making: Identify risk patterns and segmentation to support lending strategies
📊 Interactive Dashboard: Power BI visuals make it easy to monitor trends in real-time
⏱️ Efficient Reporting: Automates monthly and comparative (MTD/PMTD) analysis
🧠 Skill Showcase: Demonstrates real-world application of SQL, Power BI, and analytical storytelling
